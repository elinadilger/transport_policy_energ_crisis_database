**1	Documentation**
The database includes data on the policies implemented by the 27 EU member states, as well as Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, in response to the energy crisis in the transport sector. 
The energy crisis is defined as starting from the beginning of the last quarter of 2021, and policies implemented or announced up until the beginning of April 2023 were included in the data. 
This database is the first of its kind, focusing specifically on the transport sector and compiling the implemented policies from these thirty countries. 
To obtain the data, an overview of national fiscal policy responses to the energy crisis by the think tank Bruegel from March 2023 was utilised as the foundation for further research (Sgaravatti et al., 2023). T
he Bruegel analysis mentioned policies targeting the transport sector and, at times, also offered sources for more information on the policies. However, the analysis did not list all transport policies extensively. 
Thus, the sources and policies provided were used for open-source research using Google conducted in the language of the respective country. 
Additionally, the embassies of the countries in Germany, the transport ministries of the countries and the German embassies in the respective countries were asked to provide information about the policies implemented. 
Most embassies and ministries responded, and emails and phone calls with them were used as the starting point for further open-source research. 
We used the online translator DeepL to translate the keywords for the open-source research into the respective language. 
The Google Translate Chrome plug-in was used to translate the websites into English and make them readable. 
Websites in English, German or Spanish were read in the original version. 
The text data found on the relevant policy was translated into English using Google Translate before being added to the database. 
The original text is not included in the database. Nevertheless, the links to the webpages are provided for reference. 
The webpages from which data were obtained were mainly official government websites and sometimes newspaper articles. 
Information only obtained through communication with a ministry or embassy was also included in the database together with the source. 
The database does not claim to be exhaustive, as not all implemented policies may have been captured due to several reasons such as variations in each country's definition of what constitutes a policy or a transport policy and language barriers. 


**2	Explanation of Columns**
Country: 
Lists the country which implemented the policy

Policy: 
Either lists the official name of the policy or, if there was no official English name, a translation of the official name or a name roughly describing the policy.

Status: 
Indicates if the policy existed before (existed; those policies were not used for the analysis), existed before but was changed (increased), existed before but was cancelled (cancelled), or if it was implemented newly (implemented).

Local_national: 
Indicates on which level the policies were implemented.

Gov_non-gov: 
Indicates whether the measure was adopted by the government (gov), by a non-governmental organisation (non-gov) or by the government in cooperation with a non-governmental entity (mixed).

Type: 
The policies are classified into specific policy types.

Subtype: 
Some policy categories were further divided into sub-types in this column to allow for a deeper analysis.

Stability, Justice, Foreign & Climate: 
Those four columns were used to evaluate the policies. If a policy clearly addressed the issues of one area, 1 was assigned. If its contribution was ambiguous 0.5 was assigned, and if it did not contribute, 0.

Dates: 
If there is no information on the abolition of a policy, it is assumed to still be in place. Policies which were still implemented or assumed to be at the end of March 2023 have the end date of 31.12.2100 assigned. If it was a one-time payment, the end of the year 2022 is assigned as the end date. Even if a policy retrospectively affects the whole year of 2022, the implementation date was coded as the start date and not 01.01.2022. However, it is always mentioned in the text data that the policy retrospectively applied to the whole year.

Source & Text Columns: 
The source columns list the webpage or source were the information on the policy was found. The text column lists the text found at this source relevant to the policy.
