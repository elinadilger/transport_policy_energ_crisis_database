 The ratchet system procedure is as follows:
 
 The special excise duty increases with the first reduction in the maximum price which leads to a reduction in the maximum price below EUR 1.70 per liter respectively for diesel or petrol, and with each subsequent reduction in the maximum price.
 The increase in the special excise duty is equal to half of the reduction in the maximum price excluding VAT.

 The calculation formulas aim, on the one hand, to pass on the various costs of the production and supply chain; on the other hand, to protect the consumer against price fluctuations and rises.
 
 In this regard, road fuel prices (petrol and diesel) have risen considerably in recent weeks, particularly as a result of the conflict in Ukraine.
 
 This is why the government has decided to take temporary measures to mitigate the major impact that the current price increases are having for households and businesses, by lowering the excise rate for petrol and diesel at 144.6282 euros per 1,000 liters. This equates to a discount of 0.175 euro per liter at the pump. The level of the discount will also depend on the fluctuations of the international market and the application of the VAT rate.

 On 8 June 2022, the Act amending Act No. 16/1993 Coll., on Road Tax, as amended, was published in the Collection of Laws under No. 142/2022 Coll. The Act took effect on 1 July 2022 and contains measures against the growing fuel prices, in particular a significant reduction in the subject of the road tax and road tax rates. The amendment is abolishing the road tax for cars and trucks weighing up to 12 tonnes. The government sees this measure as helping small and medium-sized companies in particular, and the cancellation is intended to be permanent.
 
 The intention was to cancel the advance payment for the first quarter of 2022 already, due on 15 April 2022. 
 
 With regard to the fact that the amendment to the Road Tax Act was not likely to be processed and approved before the due date of the first 2022 quarterly advance payment on 15 April 2022, the Minister of Finance has waived the payment of quarterly advances for the road tax for the entire year 2022. After the final approval of the amendment the road tax was abolished for vehicles weighing up to 12 tons from 2022, no payment obligation arises for these vehicles retrospectively for the whole year 2022.
 
 However the legal advance payment waiver applies to all vehicles regardless of their weight. Thus, beyond the original intention of the government, there has been some relief for haulers using vehicles weighing more than 12 tons. This support is only in the form of the option to defer the payment of the road tax, as the amendment abolished the tax only for low-weight vehicles. If the deferral is used, the road tax on these vehicles will only be paid on the basis of the road tax return to be filed for the entire year by 31 January 2023. Additionally, to this option there is also a significant reduction of road tax rates to the benefit of the haulers of big trucks meaning an important fiscal benefit for those companies. this applies retrospectively to the whole year of 2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For data collection, the MF uses a web application in order to minimize the administrative burden on both sides. The Ministry of Finance will therefore prepare a price regulation setting the maximum amount of margins, and if the margins do not fall adequately during April, we are ready to introduce this price regulation. We will also currently extend our price control to include real purchase prices to be able to monitor wholesale refining margins as well. We consider the inspection of distributors to be necessary also in order to be able to monitor the projection of reduced consumption tax by CZK 1.50 into the final price of diesel and gasoline for drivers in the period from June to September of this year.

The average real margin is the margin of all gas stations, taking into account the discharge of each of them. In August, it reached CZK 1.9 per liter for Diesel (versus CZK 3.6 indicative margin) and for Natural 95, CZK 2.6 per liter (versus CZK 4.8 indicative margin).“The relatively low real margin shows that higher indicative margin values ​​are caused by some high-margin, high-price sellers. In simple terms, this means that the monitored margin is artificially increased by gas stations with a small flow but high selling prices. These sellers are abusing the emergency situation and are not reducing the sales prices for drivers quickly and flexibly enough, as prices are falling on the European commodity market,"" explains Zbyněk Stanjura. The MF proceeded to supplement the current reporting of the indicative margin with a real margin after agreement with the petroleum unions, i.e. ČAPPO and the Union of Independent Petroleum Workers. The real margin with a higher indicative value is calculated by the MF on the basis of weighted arithmetic averages thanks to extended price monitoring by real purchase and average sales prices and their real sold volumes.
 
 After evaluating the August data from price controls, the Ministry of Finance will not proceed with the introduction of price regulation at distributors and gas stations for the time being. ""We are currently following a slightly downward trend in margins for gasoline and a faster downward trend in diesel. Above all, however, we see large price dispersions across the market, and by introducing widespread regulatory measures, we would punish even cheaper sellers with a fair pricing policy. Therefore, for the time being, unless further developments in the market force us to do otherwise, we have decided to follow the path of targeted measures and about a month ago we filed a complaint with the ÚOHS due to the suspicion of a cartel agreement,"" says Zbyněk Stanjura and adds:""At the same time, we are also waiting for the final proposal of the European Commission, which will set the parameters of the windfall tax.

 “We have made a decision: the price of gasoline and diesel cannot exceed 480 forints [€1.30],” Orban said on his Facebook page. The caps on petrol and diesel will last for three months.
 
 European consumers have faced rising energy prices amid tighter supplies in recent months. Petrol prices in Hungary have hit records, climbing by about a third since the start of this year.

Initially planned to last for three months the cap was extended to last until July.,https://abouthungary.hu/news-in-brief/government-caps-price-of-petrol-and-diesel-at-huf-480,"The Hungarian government has decided to cap the price of petrol and diesel at HUF 480 (EUR 1.3) per liter from Nov. 15.
 
 Gergely Gulyás, Head of the Prime Minister's Office, said putting a cap on fuel prices may boost the economy and help to reduce inflation. Gulyás noted that fuel prices had shot up during the past year, adding that Hungary had the sixth or seventh cheapest fuel in the EU. In four countries petrol is cheaper, while in Malta and Cyprus the current prices are similar, he said, adding that Croatia was the only other EU country to cap its fuel prices, at the equivalent of HUF 550.
 
 Concerning utility bills, Gulyás said Europe was facing an energy crisis, with the price of natural gas having increased by an average of 400 percent in European markets. This has had a knock-on effect on the price of electricity, which has doubled over the past year. He added that household bills had increased in every European country except for Hungary, which maintains a cap on utility fees. He slammed the leftist opposition for suggesting that the government’s scheme to cut utility bills was unsustainable, and he confirmed the government’s commitment to keeping consumer utility prices at the same level.",Hungarian Ministry for Energy & Wirtschaftsattaché der Botschaft von Ungarn in Berlin (David.velki@mfa.gov.hu),"The introduction of the fuel price cap by the Hungarian Government aimed to offset the economic recession caused by the Covid-19 epidemic, the meanwhile increased energy prices and the accompanying inflation. In order to protect the Hungarian households and consumers, the government imposed introduced the fuel price cap at the end 2021 as part of its utility reduction policy. In order to keep fuel prices and inflation under control, the government set the maximum possible price of 95-octane motor gasoline and diesel fuel at HUF 480 per liter from November 15, 2021. The price cap did not apply to premium fuels. This measure aimed at keeping the rise in fuel prices under control was initially set for a period of three months.
 The outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian war on February 24, 2022 resulted in further destabilization of the economic situation and uncertainty appeared on the market of energy carriers. Speculation on Russian crude oil shortages resulted in a significant spike. In response to Russian aggression, the European Union adopted several rounds of sanctions, which affected the energy sector and caused further price pressure. All these circumstances prevented the Hungarian Government from abolishing the fuel price cap, which was initially intended as a temporary solution. Constantly monitoring the war situation and energy prices, the Government extended the temporal scope of the fuel price cap several times. The measure with a temporary effect of February 15,2022 was first extended until May 15, secondly until July 1st, thirdly until October 1st, and then until the end of 2022.
 Hungarian families paid one of the lowest prices in Europe for fuel, in addition to electricity and gas. The measure also had a positive effect on the economy, the fuel price cap contributed half a percent to reducing inflation.
 The purchase of fuel at the official price, which was available without conditions and restrictions, entailed a large amount of excess consumption, which carried a risk of security of supply, and resulted in fuel shortages in many parts of the country, which were mostly caused by the entry of vehicles not registered in Hungary for the sole purpose of refueling. As a result of the fuel available at a low price, we have encountered the phenomenon of fuel tourism in Hungary from neighboring countries. For security of supply reasons, the Hungarian Government also had to redefine the personal scope of the measure.
 The fuel price cap guaranteed the lowest fuel prices in Europe for Hungarian families for more than a year. Due to the supply difficulties experienced in the region, the amount of imports also decreased in the domestic market. Without the backlog of import volumes, the Hungarian Government could no longer maintain security of supply, we have reached our logistical limits. Therefore, by abolishing the official fuel price in December 2022, the Government eliminated tensions in the domestic fuel market and curbed panic buying, with the reduction and cessation of which the supply situation at domestic fuel stations gradually settled.",https://kormany.hu/hirek/tovabbi-harom-honappal-meghosszabbitja-a-benzinarstopot-a-kormany,"Although the price of gasoline has risen dramatically all over the world in the past year, even before the introduction of the price ceiling, only a few people could buy fuel cheaper than Hungarian consumers in Europe. However, these costs significantly influence the functioning of the economy and the prices of other products, thus burdening families and businesses multiple times. In order to keep fuel prices and inflation under control, the government set the maximum possible price of 95-octane motor gasoline and diesel fuel at HUF 480 per liter from November 15, 2021.

In the first phase, the measure was for three months, that is, it would have been effective until February 15 this year. However, taking into account the world market and other conditions and processes, the government decided to maintain the measure until May 15, 2022.

This is a historic tax cut that will particularly benefit the construction industry. In addition, reduced road use tax contributes to a reduction in fuel taxes, also for households. These tax changes help to reduce pump prices for fuel. Overall, the total fuel taxes are reduced by approx. NOK 2.2 billion, after the increase in CO2 taxes has been taken into account.
 
 - Fuel prices have increased sharply through 2022. Many households and businesses experience high fuel prices as a major challenge. Reduced fuel taxes help make everyday life a little easier for households and businesses, and will mean a lot especially for the construction industry, says Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum.
 
 The road use tax on fuel is reduced by a total of NOK 1.88 billion.
 Higher CO2 tax in road traffic increases the state's revenue by NOK 1.26 billion. The net tax reduction on fuel in road traffic will thus be in excess of NOK 600 million.
 
 Removing the basic tax on mineral oil means a relief of NOK 1.95 billion. Higher CO2 tax for non-road machines increases the state's income by NOK 390 million, including the new rate for those subject to quotas. The net tax reduction on fuel for non-road machinery (agricultural and construction machinery and industry) will thus be approximately NOK 1.56 billion.

The shields include reduction of VAT rates: - to 0 percent. on food previously subject to the 5% rate; – up to 0 percent for fertilisers, plant protection products and other agricultural production aids (instead of 8%); – up to 0 percent natural gas (instead of 23%); – up to 5 percent for electricity and heat (instead of 23%); – up to 8 percent for engine fuels (instead of 23%).

The package of preferences also includes a reduction to the minimum level of excise duty on motor fuels, light fuel oil and electricity, as well as an exemption from this tax on the sale of electricity to households. Under the shields, the sale of motor fuels is also exempt from retail sales tax.

The changes are introduced by the Act of 7 July 2022 on crowdfunding for business ventures and assistance to borrowers (Journal of Laws of 2022, item 1488).

At the same time, the excise duty solutions, which are favorable for taxpayers, were extended. It is about lowering to the minimum EU level rates for electricity, light fuel oil and some motor fuels (diesel oil, biocomponents constituting intrinsic fuels, petrol and LPG).

 support from the state budget of 0.25 lei/litre, including VAT, for economic operators granting this reduction.

 The reduced excise duties on energy products first kicked in on 1 February as part of a package of measures to mitigate the impact of energy price hikes on the population and businesses.
 
 The government later also capped the retail and wholesale prices of regular petrol and diesel fuel. It has recently also extended the cap on the prices of heating oil by another month.
 
 Announcing a new extension of the reduced excise duties after the cabinet session on Thursday, the Finance Ministry said it was trying to help the population and businesses cope with the high oil prices by fiscal policy measures as well.
 
 The reduced excise duties are 35.9 cents per litre of petrol, 33 cents per litre of diesel, 7.875 cents per litre of heating oil and 85.5 cents per megawatt hour of natural gas for heating.
 
 Unless the government extends by the end of this month administered prices of most motor fuels, these are expected to go up next week.
 
 Estimates by the newspaper Finance show petrol prices could exceed EUR 1.60 a litre on 1 May unless the government extends the price cap. Diesel could cost EUR 1.82 a litre, taking into account reduced excise.
 
 As of February the excise duty on electricity was reduced from EUR 3.05 per MWh to EUR 1.525 per MWh for small consumers and from EUR 1.80 to EUR 0.90 per MWh for large consumers (over 10.000 MWh per year).
 
 The reduced duty has been extended by three months, while the temporary freeze on network charges remains in force until the end of April.
 
 Asked about a potential extension or new measures to mitigate price hikes beyond the planned periods, the Infrastructure Ministry has not provided an answer.
